Our telegram bot @MakeANewFriBot aims to help users start or continue a conversation with their friends by 
allowing users to choose a category they like, then randomly generating a relevant question that can spark 
discussions, laughters, and definitely friendship! <br/> <br/>Following this, our webpage allows you to explore further 
ideas of activities that you can take part in, eateries you can binge at, and 
entertainment marathons (eg. movie marathons) you can participate in with your friends! Relevant links to our
 webpages will also be sent at the same time to enhance and guide the conversation.
<br/> <br/>
